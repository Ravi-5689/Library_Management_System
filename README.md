üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

XAMPP: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution package. Download from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.

Git: A distributed version control system. Download from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

1. Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP for your operating system.

Once installed, open the XAMPP Control Panel.

Start the Apache and MySQL modules. Ensure their status indicators turn green.

2. Database Setup
Access phpMyAdmin in your web browser by navigating to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

Import the Database Schema:

You'll need the library_db.sql file. This file contains the SQL commands to create the library_db database and its tables (books, members, issued_books).

In phpMyAdmin, click the "Import" tab.

Click "Choose File" and select your library_db.sql file.

Click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page to execute the SQL commands.

3. Project Files Setup
Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your XAMPP's htdocs directory.

Windows: cd C:\xampp\htdocs\

macOS: cd /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/

Linux: cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/

Clone this repository into the htdocs directory:

git clone <your-repository-url> library_management

(Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of this Git repository)

Alternatively, if you've downloaded a ZIP file of the project, extract the library_management folder directly into your XAMPP htdocs directory.
